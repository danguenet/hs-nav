## Data Collection and Usage

We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive data. HS Nav operates entirely on your local device, using Chrome's local storage to manage settings and preferences. Specifically:

- **Local Storage**: User preferences, such as custom navigation links or shortcut configurations, are stored locally in Chrome's storage and are not transmitted to any external servers.
- **No External Communication**: The extension does not send or receive any data from external servers, third-party services, or any other entities.

## Permissions

To function effectively, HS Nav requires certain permissions within your Chrome browser:

1. **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to access the current tabâ€™s URL to determine the appropriate HubSpot navigation (Account ID).
2. **`storage`**: Allows the extension to save user preferences locally in your browser.

These permissions are strictly used to enable the intended functionality of the extension and do not involve the collection or transmission of data.

## Third-Party Services

HS Nav does not integrate with or rely on any third-party services. All functionality is self-contained within the Chrome browser.

## Your Privacy Rights

As HS Nav does not collect any personal data, there is no personal information to access, modify, or delete. You maintain full control over the extension by:

- **Managing Permissions**: You can review or revoke the extension's permissions in your browser settings.
- **Uninstalling the Extension**: If you no longer wish to use HS Nav, you can remove it from Chrome at any time.
