HubSpot's default search is great for finding records, but not for other types of navigation. It can take multiple clicks to locate "Lists," "Campaigns," or other key sections of the app. **HS Nav** is a Chrome extension designed to solve that problem. With a simple shortcut, you can pull up a search bar and jump directly to where you need to go.

## Default Shortcuts

- **Open HS Nav**:
  - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+K`
  - macOS: `Command+Shift+K`
- **Default HubSpot Search**:
  - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+K`
  - macOS: `Command+K`

If you're looking for the **default HubSpot search** to find specific record, use `Command+K` on macOS or `Ctrl+K` on other systems.  
To quickly **navigate** to "Lists," "Contacts," "Deals," or any other major section in HubSpot, simply add a `Shift` to that combination to activate **HS Nav**.
